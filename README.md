A restaurant menu UI/UX project is the process of designing a menu that is
both visually appealing and easy to use. The goal of a good restaurant menu
is to make it easy for customers to find the dishes they want, and to
encourage them to order more.
Designing a visually appealing and intuitive restaurant menu interface was a delightful challenge.
I leveraged my understanding of user psychology and design principles to create a menu that not only whetted the appetite but also streamlined the ordering process.
